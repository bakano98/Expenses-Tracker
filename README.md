# Expenses-Tracker

A mobile app that allows you to track your expenses. You can add more categories as you need to.

# Features
- Monitor your spendings
  - Overview of your spendings for:
    - So far
    - This year
    - This month
    - Last 30 days
    - Today
  - Graph to show you your spending for this month
  - Pie chart to show you the breakdown of your spendings for this month
- Add new spendings
- Add new categories

# Note
The app is super minimalistic in the sense that it has all necessary features to be usable, while also having a not-so-amazing UI.  
As time goes by, I will update this app more in order to make it look more pleasant, so that _you_ can have a better experience using it as well!
